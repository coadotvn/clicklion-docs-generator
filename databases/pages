In the left menu, we have `General` and `Geo` report options.\r\n\r\n## General Report\r\n\r\nGeneral report will provide you stats (in many metrics) of a source entity in a specified date range with a specified frequency. To get a report:\r\n\r\n1. Make sure you are in `General Report` section\r\n\r\n2. Choose a source entity in the box which displays `Select report source`\r\n\r\n3. If there is no data for that source entity, you will see a notice saying `No report data for this time frame`, ...
